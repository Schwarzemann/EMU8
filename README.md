# EMU8
EMU8, as the name suggests, is a CHIP-8 emulator written purely in C. It is still in a very early stage and I don't recommend using it besides experimenting. This little thing was also an idea that came to me in a Sunday afternoon.

## How to build
The makefile inside the project can be used to build the whole thing. But you can also compile it manually.

```
make
```
```
make clean  - (to clean the folder)
```
